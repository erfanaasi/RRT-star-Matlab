# RRT-star-Matlab
RRT* implementation in Matlab, with spherical obstacles
---------------------------------------------------------
This package includes standard RRT* impelementation in Matlab, with simple dynamics and spherical obstacles in the environment. 

Playing with the parameters of the case study is possible through changing the file "data.mat" (for example changing the start or goal points, or the position and size of the obstacles). 

Moreover for including compicated dynamic models, overwrite them in the "steer.m" file.
